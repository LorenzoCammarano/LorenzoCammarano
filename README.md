👋 Hi!

💻 I’m passionate about technology and cybersecurity, currently training at Cyber HackAdemy, where I’m diving into topics like ethical hacking, threat analysis, and incident response.

🔐 My journey started with a deep interest in hardware and software, learning how to maintain, upgrade, and configure systems. Now, my goal is to specialize in cybersecurity, enhancing my skills in network security, penetration testing, and vulnerability assessment.

🌱 I’m a curious and motivated learner, always eager to grow and collaborate. I enjoy teamwork and believe in knowledge-sharing as a key to improvement.

🤝 Looking to collaborate on cybersecurity projects, CTFs, and security tools.

📫 Feel free to connect with me here on GitHub!
